# W3C Federated Identity Working Group

This GitHub repository serves the [W3C Federated Identity Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/). 

The FedID WG works together with the [FedID CG](https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/) ([repo](https://github.com/fedidcg/) ) as described in the [CG-WG process doc](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/Administration/blob/main/proposals-CG-WG.md) (draft). 

* [FedCM](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM) [Draft spec](https://w3c-fedid.github.io/FedCM/)  transferred from the FedIDCG August 2024. Issues against the specification and proposed fixes (pull requests) should be filed in this repo.
* FPWD [published](https://www.w3.org/TR/fedcm/) 20 August, 2024

A recharter has been proposed (13 August, 2024) to add the [WICG Digital Credentials API](https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials). If the recharter passes, the Working Group will follow a similar process for that specification.
